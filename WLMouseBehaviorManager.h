    @abstract   A class deal with all mouse behavior about mouse hotspot within the YLView.
    @discussion Welly uses <code>NSTrackingArea</code> to catch mouse movement inside the view. All tracking area for mouse hotspot should be created by the API provided in this file, so that they would have consistent behaviors. Currently welly's mouse hotspot only deal with <code>mouseUp:</code> and <code>menuForEvent:</code> (right click) clicking event. <code>mouseDown:</code> and <code>mouseDragged:</code> are implemented in <code>YLView</code> class, and they have no business with mouse hotspot.

 Finally, this method would check mouse's current position. If the mouse is inside the given <code>rect</code>, then a <code>mouseEntered:</code> message would be sent to the manager itself, so the event can be dispatch to the newly built area immediately.
 
 Notice that, the hot spot handlers should use this method to add tracking areas into the view. Otherwise they have to deal with the initial mouse enter event by themselves.
